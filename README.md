## Space Tours
### Rapyd Hackathon Submission [More Details](https://htg2.devpost.com/)
The project consists of an angular front end with an express backend. Both projects are located under the appropriate folders within this repository.

### Demo
A demo can be found [here](https://rapyd-flight-booking.vercel.app/). The backend runs on an heroku hobby instance so it might take a few seconds to wake up. 

### Running
```
$ cd flight-booking
$ npm install
$ ng serve #serves frontend locally
$ cd ../flight-booking-backend
$ npm install
$ node index.js # Runs backend locally
```
